                    <p><b>“Words are containers for power. You choose what kind of power they carry.”</b></p>
                    <p>It is words, outlines, bends, and phrases that manifest the kernel of imagination and novelty of a student in the real world. I believe in my ideas and find pathways to present them to others through voice, notes, and illustrations. The meaning of words crystallizes perceptions that shape our views, drive our behavior, and ultimately, create our domain. The quality of our words attracts others to our cause or repels them from it. Your words can change everything. Welcome to the new generation of the Enigma Webzine of DPS Sharjah!</p>

                    <p>This is why I believe that only by interacting with others, perfection can be accomplished. Writing gives me the much needed wings, to reach out to maximum people. I also appreciate the feedback which motivates me to improvise, thus making my writing even more powerful.  Writing good editorials is chiefly telling people what they think not what you think. We welcome you to Enigma to share your interesting ideas.</p>

                    <p>I want to give all my fellow students a chance to show their talent on literature-based topics. As we all know, every child has an author or a poet inside and all we have to do is to help them present it in a way that everyone would be impressed with. In this academic year, my goal is to help students in the primary wing to showcase their talent to the world. We can achieve this by starting at our most creative site-ENIGMA! The students can exhibit their writing skills through the site and enhance their creativity.</p>
